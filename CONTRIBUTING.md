# Contributing · Geostrophic Wind Ruler

👋 Welcome — and thank you for your interest.  
This project combines **practical meteorology** and **nautical decision support**.
Small improvements can have large consequences, so contributions follow a few principles.

---

## 📌 Before you start
Please consider:

1. **Predictability beats precision**  
   - If a change makes the tool sharper but less stable → not accepted.
   - Interaction reliability is higher priority than pixel-perfect rendering.

2. **Device priorities**  
   - Primary: Desktop & Laptop
   - Secondary: Tablets (iPad)
   - Tertiary: Mobile phones (Android / iOS)
   - “Works, but not optimised” is acceptable.

3. **Learning tool – not automation**  
   This is not a forecast engine.  
   No API calls, no automatic forecast downloads, no routing suggestions.
